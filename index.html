			<h1> Welcome to my website! </h1>
			
			<p> Welcome to my website. I'm typing this using HTML. It's not actually a coding language,
			but it's used for programming website. I'm not sure what HTML stands for, but it's
			probably something like 'Hairy Tall Mating Lemons'. Cool, eh? </p>
			
			<p> And yes, Dugg, I did program this tout seul. How 'bout that? </p>
			
			<p> And I'll end with a lovely picture and a link to my favourite website: 
				<a href="http://www.duolingo.com">surprise website!</a>
